# MLRAG: Machine Learning Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Overview
MLRAG is designed to provide relevant answers based on user queries by utilizing a combination of machine learning techniques and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This project demonstrates how to analyze and query documents, such as PDFs, using advanced ML models.

## Features
- Import and process PDF documents for analysis.
- Query-based information retrieval using RAG models.
- Integration with machine learning libraries like PyTorch.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Google Colab or a similar Jupyter Notebook environment
- Libraries: `torch`, `numpy`, and `pandas`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install torch numpy pandas
    ```

## Usage
1. Mount Google Drive to access data files (if using Google Colab):
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```
2. Specify the path to your document:
    ```python
    PDF_path = "/content/drive/My Drive/MLRAG/MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf"
    ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform document analysis and query.

## File Structure
- `MLRAG.ipynb`: The main notebook containing code and explanations for the project.
- Data files: Place relevant documents (e.g., PDFs) in the appropriate directory.
